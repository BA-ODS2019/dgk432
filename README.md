Here you find all the "hand-ins" from class (BATV) 4900-E19;<b/>
INF Open Data Science (BATV) at Copenhagen University. <b/>

I used data from three different places ...<p/>

* For P1, we used a Titanic dataset for basic Data Analysis - provided to us by the teacher as a *.csv file
* For P2, we had to collect/fetch the data from i.e. **The Guardian** - after having acquired "the API key" (open API)
* Finally for P3, we had to export our dataset from SMK Open - by use of their Open API search interface 

*The titanic dataset is available via the data library* in this Github repo.

## Supplementary materials and curricula

Lecture notes, different assignments and lots of literature where covered during the 3 months course.
