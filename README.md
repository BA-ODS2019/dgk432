Here you find all the "hand-ins" from class (BATV) 4900-E19;<br/>

The class had all its focus on working with data - understanding the programming language Python and getting access to data.<br/>

During the class we used data from different places ...<p/>

* For P1, we used a Titanic dataset for basic Data Analysis - provided to us by the teacher as a *.csv file
* For P2, we had to collect/fetch the data from i.e. *The Guardian* - after having acquired "the API key" (open API)
* Finally for P3, we had to export our dataset from SMK Open - by use of their Open API search interface 

The titanic dataset is available via the */data library* in this Github repo.

## Supplementary materials and curricula

Lecture notes, different assignments and lots of literature where covered during the 3 months course.
